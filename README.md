## Biography

Zhiming obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020. He received his B.S. degree in Computer Science from the [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2014.

Zhiming’s research is mainly focused on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Leading a group in the [Apex Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, he also works on first-order optimization, optimal transport, and other related problems. Prior to that, Zhiming worked on computer graphics in the early years of his Ph.D. (2014-2016), focused on surface reflectance acquisition.

Zhiming has a broad interest in machine learning and deep learning, and he prefers fundamental and theoretical research. Currently, he holds a special interest in the optimization and generalization of deep neural networks and GANs.

* <details><summary>Click to expand a brief introduction.</summary>We study the cause of training instability of GANs from the perspective of optimal discriminative function and demonstrate its superiority against the divergence perspective. Under a generalized formulation of GANs, we show that GANs with unrestricted discriminative function space generally does not guarantee its convergence, suffing from a gradient uninformativeness issue, and Lipschitz regularization on the discriminative function can generally resolve this issue and guarantee the convergence of GANs, leading to a new family of GANs named Lipschitz GANs. All tested instances of this family consistently outperform WGAN in experiments.</details>

* <details><summary>Click to expand a brief introduction.</summary>We study the convergence issue of Adam optimizer. With the proposed perspective of accumulated step size  (i.e., net update factor), we showed that the key issue in Adam lies in its biased adaptive learning rate caused by the correlation between the adaptive term v_t and the current gradient g_t, and a temporal shift operation is proposed to solve such an issue. Our new understanding of the role of v_t also free v_t from its traditional update rule, leading to more interesting variants. Particularly, with dimension reduction operation in v_t, we achieve the so-called adaptive learning rate SGD, which removes the global gradient scale but keeps the relative scales.</details>

* <details><summary>Click to expand a brief introduction.</summary>We significantly reduce the number of images required for spatially-varying surface reflectance (SVBRDF) acquisition, by solving an exact low-rank representation and chasing an extreme sparsity. The number of images required droped from thousands to tens, and high-quality SVBRDF acquisition from a single image becomes possible for the first time.</details>

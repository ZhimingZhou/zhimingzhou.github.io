### Biography

Zhiming obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020. He received his B.S. degree in Computer Science from [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2014.

Zhiming’s research is mainly focused on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Leading a group in the [Apex lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, he also works on first-order optimization, optimal transport, and other related problems. Prior to that, Zhiming worked on computer graphics in the early years of his Ph.D. (2014-2016), focused on surface reflectance acquisition.

Zhiming has a broad interest in machine learning and deep learning, and he prefers fundamental and theoretical research. Currently, he holds a special interest in the optimization and generalization of deep neural networks and GANs.

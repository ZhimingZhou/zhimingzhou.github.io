Iâ€™m looking for talented students with enthusiasm for fundamental research in machine learning/artificial intelligence.

- Overall:
	- I have a very high standard for research and require students to do RIGOROUS and IN-DEPTH research INDEPENDENTLY.
	- As the entrance assessment, you will need to explain a top conference/journal paper to me clearly and entirely.

<!--  -->
- Our target:
	- Top-notch research that pursues perfection and truth (which will naturally lead to publications in top conferences/journals).
	- I personally prefer theoretical/theory-driven research on fundamental topics in the field of machine learning.

<!--  -->
- The first thing you will need to do when you become one of my students:
	- Read 20 ~ 50 papers from top conferences/journals.
		- In topics that interest you, or just somehow randomly.
		- This is to familiarize you with the basic paradigms of scientific papers and help find/determine your research topic.
	- Make sure to understand the following key information in each paper:
		- What is the problem they are concerning?
		- What is their main contribution/difference compared to previous work(s)?
	- What is your judgment? Do you have any criticism of them?
		- Is the problem important? Is the contribution significant?
		- Try to criticize their problem/setup, motivation, deduction/logic, solution, assumption/theory, experiment design, etc.
			- Why does it have to be like that? Is it the best possible? Can you do better in any aspect?
		- Is there any limitation? Did they overlook any important issues/aspects?
	
<!--  -->
- What will be your research topic:
	- We DO NOT assign topics to students in principle.
	- Find your research topic on your own by reading papers, and I will always be there if you need any guidance.
	- When you have read 50 papers and still haven't found a suitable/interested topic, I may give my suggestions.

<!--  -->
- My style:
	- I might be generally very nice, but I can be rather critical upon research.
	- You will be required to build a DEEP and CLEAR understanding of your research topic and related works.
		- This may take quite a while, but it is a prerequisite for us to start the real research.
	- I will guide and force you to think deeply, clearly, and logically. Hope we have the same belief that:
		- Superficial understanding may lead to specious conclusions.
		- Deeper thinking can bring simpler/better solutions.

<!--  -->
- Characteristics that I value most:
	- [5'] Good (SELF-)LEARNING ability.
	- [5'] The ability to think deeply.
	- [4'] Good intuition and critical thinking.
	- [4'] Clear and strict logic.
	- [3'] Good at math and programming.
	- [3'] Confidence and perseverance.

<!--  -->
- Management:
	- There will be a weekly meeting, which is typically online and one-on-one.
		- You will need to summarize the discussions in the meeting whereafter to ensure a good grasp of the points.
	- You will need to report your daily research progress (3~5 times a week, depending on your stage), which summarizes:
		- New techniques you learn;
		- New papers and/or related content you read;
		- New thoughts about your research topic or the related;
		- New experiments and/or their analysis; and so on.
	- You will need to summarize and review your research quarterly.
	- There will be an ENTRANCE ASSESSMENT and a PROBATIONARY period of one semester for every newcomer.

<!--  -->
- Principle of authorship:
	- We determine the authorship according to the contribution. The tentative score-based rules are as follows:
		- Idea: 0 ~ 2 points, depending on the importance.
		- Theory: 1 ~ 4 points, depending on the importance and workload.
		- Coding: 0 ~ 3 points, depending on the workload.
		- Writing: 1 ~ 2 points, depending on the workload.
	- The points of each part will be allocated to persons who participated, according to their contribution.
	- For conferences/journals that typically do not regard authors as of equal contribution:
		- The authors with higher contribution points have a higher priority in choosing the position in the author list.
		- For authors that share similar contributions, the relatively lower-ranked can argue for a claim of equal contribution.
			- E.g., their difference in contribution points is less than 1.
	- In principle, people with too little contribution will not be regarded as one of the authors.
		- E.g., get less than 1 point, even though somehow participated in.

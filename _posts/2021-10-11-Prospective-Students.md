I’m looking for talented students with enthusiasm for fundamental research in machine learning and/or artificial intelligence.

- Overall:
	- I have a very high standard for research and require students to conduct RIGOROUS and IN-DEPTH research INDEPENDENTLY.
	- It can be hard for most students. Applying is only suggested if you think you are extraordinary and plan to work hard.

<!--  -->
- Our target:
	- Top research that (at least) can be published in top conferences/journals, like ICML/NIPS/JMLR.
	- I personally prefer fundamental and theoretical research that has practical impacts.

<!--  -->
- The first thing you will need to do when you become one of my students: 
	- Read 20 ~ 50 papers from top conferences/journals.
		- In any topic: the one(s) you are interested in, or the one(s) I am interested in, or just any.
	- Make sure to understand the following key information in each paper:
		- What is the problem they are solving?
		- What is their main contribution?
		- What is their main difference compared with previous work?
	- What is your judgment? What do you think of this paper?
		- Is the problem important?
		- Is their contribution significant?
		- Are their theoretical/experimental results solid?
	- Do you have any criticism of them?
		- Try to criticize their motivation, their assumption, their logic, their solution/theory, their experiment, etc.
		- Is there any limitation? Did they overlook any important issues/aspects? Can you do better?
	- Optionally, you may summarize and organize these in a document to help build your own understanding of these topics.
	- Note that this typically requires a good high-level understanding, while details are often not necessary and can be omitted.
	
<!--  -->
- What will be your research topic:
	- We DO NOT assign topics to students in principle.
	- Find your research topic on your own by reading papers and I will always be there if you need any guidance.
	- When you have read 50 papers and still haven't found a suitable/interested topic, I will give my suggestions.

<!--  -->
- My style:
	- I might be generally very nice, but upon research, I can be rather critical.
	- You will be required to build a DEEP and CLEAR understanding of your research topic and related works.
		- This may take a long time, but it will be a PREREQUISITE for us to start the real RESEARCH.
	- I will guide and force you to think deeply, clearly, and logically. I wish we have the same belief that:
		- Superficial understanding may lead to specious conclusions.
		- Deeper thinking can bring simpler/better solutions.

<!--  -->
- Characteristics that I value most:	
	- Good (SELF-)LEARNING ability.
	- Confidence and perseverance.
	- Critical thinking and clear logic.
	- Good intuition and good at math.	

<!--  -->
- Our principle of authorship:
	- We determine the authorship according to the contribution. The tentative score-based rules are as follows:
		- Idea: 0 ~ 2 points, depends on the importance.
		- Theory: 1 ~ 4 points, depends on the importance and workload.
		- Coding: 0 ~ 3 points, depends on the workload.
		- Writing: 1 ~ 2 points, depends on the workload.
	- The points of each part will be allocated to persons who participated in, according to their contribution.
	- For conferences/journals that typically do not regard authors as of equal contribution:
		- The authors with higher contribution points have higher priority to choose the position in the author list.
		- For authors that share similar contribution, the relatively lower-ranked can argue for a claim of equal contribution.
			- E.g., their difference in contribution points is less than 1.
	- In principle, people with too little contribution will not be regarded as one of the authors.
		- E.g., get less than 1 point, even though somehow participated in.

<!-- 
- How much money will you get each month:
	- It will typically be the same as the standard or the amount that is allowable and I can afford without pressure.
	- If you want more, I can apply for some founding but you will need to do some work for the founding.
- How much effort of mine will you get to guide you:
	- It mainly depends on how much effort you put in.
		- But surely priority will be given to projects that I’m particularly interested in and students who show great potential.
	- I have once heard the x^a model, and I think it is interesting and feasible, where x is your effort and a > 1, x^a will be my expected effort. Note that x = 1 is some standard that can be surpassed.

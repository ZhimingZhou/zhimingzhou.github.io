I’m looking for talented students with enthusiasm for fundamental research in machine learning / artificial intelligence.

- Overall:
	- I have a very high standard for research and require students to do RIGOROUS and IN-DEPTH research INDEPENDENTLY.

<!--  -->
- Our target:
	- Top research that (at least) can be published in top conferences/journals, like ICML/NIPS/JMLR.
	- I personally prefer fundamental and theoretical research that has practical impacts.

<!--  -->
- The first thing you will need to do when you become one of my students:
	- Read 20 ~ 50 papers from top conferences/journals.
		- In any topic: the one(s) you are interested in, or just any.
	- Make sure to understand the following key information in each paper:
		- What is the problem they are solving?
		- What is their main contribution?
		- What is their main difference compared with previous work?
	- What is your judgment? What do you think of this paper?
		- Is the problem important?
		- Is their contribution significant?
		- Are their theoretical/experimental results solid?
	- Do you have any criticism of them?
		- Try to criticize their motivation, their assumption, their logic, their solution/theory, their experiment, etc.
		- Is there any limitation? Did they overlook any important issues/aspects? Can you do better?
	- Note that this typically requires a good high-level understanding, while details are often not necessary and can be omitted.
	
<!--  -->
- What will be your research topic:
	- We DO NOT assign topics to students in principle.
	- Find your research topic on your own by reading papers and I will always be there if you need any guidance.
	- When you have read 50 papers and still haven't found a suitable/interested topic, I will give my suggestions.

<!--  -->
- My style:
	- I might be generally very nice, but I can be rather critical upon research.
	- You will be required to build a DEEP and CLEAR understanding of your research topic and related works.
		- This may take a long time, but it will be a PREREQUISITE for us to start the real research.
	- I will guide and force you to think deeply, clearly, and logically. I wish we had the same belief that:
		- Superficial understanding may lead to specious conclusions.
		- Deeper thinking can bring simpler/better solutions.

<!--  -->
- Characteristics that I value most:
	- [5'] Good (SELF-)LEARNING ability.
	- [5'] CLEAR and STRICT LOGIC.
	- [4'] Good intuition and critical thinking.
	- [3'] Good at math and programming.
	- [3'] Confidence and perseverance.

<!--  -->
- Management:
	- There will be a weekly meeting, which is typically online and one-on-one.
	- You will be required to keep a diary of research, which records daily summaries of:
		- New things you learn;
		- New papers and/or related content you read;
		- New thoughts about your research topic or the related;
		- New experiments and/or their analysis, and so on.
	- You will be required to summarize and review your research monthly in writing.
	- There will be a PROBATIONAEY period of one semester for every newcomer.

<!--  -->
- Principle of authorship:
	- We determine the authorship according to the contribution. The tentative score-based rules are as follows:
		- Idea: 0 ~ 2 points, depending on the importance.
		- Theory: 1 ~ 4 points, depending on the importance and workload.
		- Coding: 0 ~ 3 points, depending on the workload.
		- Writing: 1 ~ 2 points, depending on the workload.
	- The points of each part will be allocated to persons who participated, according to their contribution.
	- For conferences/journals that typically do not regard authors as of equal contribution:
		- The authors with higher contribution points have a higher priority in choosing the position in the author list.
		- For authors that share similar contributions, the relatively lower-ranked can argue for a claim of equal contribution.
			- E.g., their difference in contribution points is less than 1.
	- In principle, people with too little contribution will not be regarded as one of the authors.
		- E.g., get less than 1 point, even though somehow participated in.

<!-- 
- How much money will you get each month:
	- It will typically be the same as the standard or the appropriate amount that I can afford without pressure.
	- If you want more, I can apply for some funding but you will need to do some work for the funding.
- How much effort of mine will you get to guide you:
	- It mainly depends on how much effort you put in.
		- But indeed priority will be given to projects that I’m particularly interested in and students who show great potential.
	- I have once heard the x^a model, and I think it is interesting and feasible, where x is your effort and a > 1, x^a will be my expected effort. Note that x = 1 is some standard that can be surpassed. 
 
 - It can be challenging for most students. Applying is only suggested if you believe you can somehow be an exception.

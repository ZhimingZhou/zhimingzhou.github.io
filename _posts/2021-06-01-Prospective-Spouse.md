I'm currently single and I'm looking forward to meeting my destined partner.

- Desired attributes 

  - I wish she is upright and decent.
  - I wish she is kind and won't easily get spiteful.
  
  - I wish she is smart and wise.
  - I wish she is knowledgeable and thoughtful.
  
  - I wish she is vigorous and positive.
  - I wish she has a clear understanding of life.
  
  - I wish she has a good physiognomy.

- Distance and location

  - I wish we can be in the same city, and I currently believe Shanghai in one of the best cities in the world.
  - I don't think start a relationship in a distance is a good idea and it is better to know each other in depth before starting a relationship.

- Parenthood

  - I wish we can have one or two children in the future.
  - I wish we can raise them largely by ourselves, including their early years.

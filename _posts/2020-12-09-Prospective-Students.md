I’m looking for TALENTED students with GENUINE enthusiasm for FUNDAMENTAL research in machine learning/artificial intelligence.

- Overall:
	- I have a very high standard for research and require students to do RIGOROUS and IN-DEPTH research INDEPENDENTLY.
	- As the entrance assessment, you will need to CLEARLY explain a RECENT paper from a top conference or journal to me.

<!--  -->
- Our goal:
	- Research that pursues perfection and truth (which will naturally lead to publications in top conferences/journals).
	- I personally prefer theoretical/theory-driven research on fundamental topics in the field of machine learning.

<!--  -->
- What will be your research topic?
	- We DO NOT assign topics to students in principle.
	- Find your own research topic by reading papers from top conferences/journals.
		- You may find papers via [https://papercopilot.com/top-venues/](https://papercopilot.com/top-venues/).
		- You may use [https://www.connectedpapers.com/](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) to find more papers related to a certain paper or topic.
		- I will always be there if you need any guidance.
	- When you have read more than 50 papers and still haven't found a suitable topic, I may give my suggestions.

<!--  -->
- The recommended way of doing research:
	1. Understanding the state-of-the-art methods and/or theories.
	2. Identifying their major limitations (focus on the high-level idea instead of the details).
	3. Attempting to address (one of) the identified limitations in a principled way.

<!--  -->
- Guidelines for reading a paper:
	- L1: Overall Idea (REQUIRED)
		- What problem is this paper concerned with?
		- What limitations of existing work motivate this study?
		- What is the main contribution of this paper? -- Try to explain the high-level idea clearly.
	- L2: Detailed Analysis (whenever possible)
		- How does the proposed method work?
			- (If applicable) How is it trained? How is it used after training? -- Understand the algorithm and data flow.
		- Why would it work as intended and better than the existing?
		- Why is it designed as such? Does it have to be like that? Are there any aspects that seem unjustified?
	- L3: Critical Assessment (have a try)
		- What is your assessment of this work? Is there any limitation? Can you do better in any aspect?
	- Warnings and tips:
		- Papers may contain minor errors. You may focus on the overall idea while dismissing some details.
		- Papers may contain misleading statements. You may focus on the mathematics, the most precise part.
		- Papers may not fully or clearly describe their methods. You may need to infer or supplement certain details.
		- Some ideas or designs may, in fact, lack solid justification. You should make your own judgments.
		- LLMs can hallucinate. Incorrect views may also spread widely. DO NOT accept any claim at face value.
		- For mathematical results, it is important to build an intuitive understanding beyond the formal derivations.

<!--  -->
- My style:
	- I might be generally nice and supportive, but I can be RATHER CRITICAL of research.
	- You will be required to build a DEEP and CLEAR understanding of your research topic and related works.
		- This may take quite a while, but it is a prerequisite for us to start the real research.
	- I will guide and force you to think deeply, clearly, and logically. Hope we have the same belief that:
		- Superficial understanding may lead to specious conclusions.
		- Deeper thinking can bring simpler/better solutions.

<!--  -->
- Management:
	- There will be a weekly meeting, which is typically online and one-on-one.
	- When presenting papers or other materials:
		- You NEED to prepare slides that SUMMARIZE and RESTRUCTURE the materials according to your understanding.
	- You are encouraged to keep a research diary, which summarizes:
		- New techniques you learn;
		- New papers and/or related content you read;
		- New thoughts about your research topic or the related;
		- New experiments and/or their analysis; and so on.
	- There will be an ENTRANCE ASSESSMENT and a PROBATIONARY period of one semester for every newcomer.

<!--  -->
- Characteristics that I value most:
	- [5'] The ability to think deeply.
	- [5'] Clear and strict logic.
	- [5'] Good intuition and critical thinking.
	- [4'] Good at math and programming.
	- [4'] Good (self-)learning ability.
	- [4'] Confidence and perseverance.

- Principle of authorship:
	- We determine the authorship according to the contribution. The tentative score-based rules are as follows:
		- Idea: 1 ~ 3 points, depending on the importance.
		- Theory: 0 ~ 4 points, depending on the importance and workload.
		- Coding: 0 ~ 4 points, depending on the workload.
		- Writing: 1 ~ 2 points, depending on the workload.
	- The points of each part will be allocated to the participants according to their contribution.
	- For conferences/journals that typically do not regard authors as of equal contribution:
		- The authors with higher contribution points have a higher priority in choosing the position in the author list.
		- For authors that share similar contributions, the relatively lower-ranked can argue for a claim of equal contribution.
			- E.g., their difference in contribution points is less than 1.
	- In principle, people with too little contribution will not be regarded as one of the authors.
		- E.g., get less than 1 point, even though somehow participated in.

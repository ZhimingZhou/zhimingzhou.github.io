I’m going to be an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I’m now looking for talented students with enthusiasm for fundamental/theoretical research in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

- Our target:

	- Top research that will be published in first tier conferences/journals, like ICML/NIPS/JMLR.
	- I personally prefer fundamental and theoretical research.
		- It includes theoretical study on fundamental [theory (level 1), tools (level 2), or applications (level 3)].
	- I personally prefer problems that have practical impacts and solutions that can be theoretically verified.
	- We DO NOT publish results without theoretical guarantee/justification.

<!--  -->
- The first thing you will need to do when you become one of my students:

	- Read 20 ~ 50 papers of first tier conferences/journals.
		- In any topic: the one(s) you are interested in, or the one(s) I am interested in, or just any.
	
	<!--  -->
	- Make sure to understand the following key information in each paper:
		- What is the problem they are solving? Why is the problem important?
		- What is their main contribution? What is the key difference compared with the prior works?
	- What is your judgement? What do you think of this paper, the problem, and their ideas?
	- Do you have any criticism on them?
		- Try to criticise their motivation, their assumption, their logic, their solution, their experiment.
		- Is there any limitation? Did they overlook any important issues/aspects?
	- Can you do better?
	
	<!--  -->
	- Optionally, summarize these in a document and classify (and rank) them.

<!--  -->
- What will be your research topic:

	- We DO NOT assign topics to students in principle.
	- Find your research topic on your own by reading papers and I will always be there if you need any guidance.
	- When you have read 50 papers and still haven't found a suitable/interested topic. I will give my suggestions.

<!--  -->
- Our principle of authorship:

	- We determine the authorship according to the contribution.
	- The tentative rules are as follows:
		- We will use a scoring system.
		- Idea: 1 ~ 2 points, depends on the importance.
		- Theory: 1 ~ 4 points, depends on the importance and complexity.
		- Coding: 0 ~ 3 points, depends on the workload.
		- Writing: 1 ~ 2 point, depends on the complexity and length.
	
	<!--  -->
	- The points of each part will be allocated to persons who participated in according to their contribution.
	- For conferences/journals that typically do not regard authors as of equal contribution:
		- The authors with higher contribution points have higher priority to choose the position in the author list.
		- For authors that share similar contribution, the relatively lower-ranked can argue for a claim of equal contribution.
			- e.g., their difference in contribution points is less than 1.
	- People with too little contribution will not be regarded as one of the authors in principle.
		- e.g., get less than 1 point, even though somehow participated in.

<!--  -->
- How much money will you get each month:

	- It will typically be the same as the standard or the amount that is allowable and I can afford without pressure.
	- If you want more, I can apply for some founding but you will need to do some work for the founding.

<!--  -->
- How much effort of mine will you get to guide you:

	- It mainly depends on how much effort you put in.
		- But surely priority will be given to projects that I’m particularly interested in.
	- I have once heard the x^a model, and I think it is interesting and feasible, where x is your effort and a > 1, x^a will be my expected effort. Note that x = 1 is some standard that can be surpassed.

<!--  -->
- [Tentatively] Inner students and outer students:

	- Given the large diversities between students that may exist, I’m planning to tentatively use the inner and outer mechanism.
	- Typically students will first become the outer students.
	- Students who have great potential and passion will be invited as inner students.
	- The outer students will be guided with regular meetings
		- And surely can also make appointments with me to discuss or chat at any time.
	- The inner students will be invited to discuss more with me or work with me on my ongoing/planned projects.

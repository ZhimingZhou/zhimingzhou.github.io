I'm currently single and I'm looking forward to meeting my destined partner.

- Desired attributes

  - I wish she is moral and decent.
  - I wish she is mild and kind.
  
  - I wish she is positive and vigorous.
  - I wish she has a good physiognomy.

  - I wish she is smart and thoughtful.
  - I wish she has a clear understanding of life.

<!--  -->
- Distance and location

  - I wish we can be in the same city and I currently believe Shanghai is one of the best cities in the world.
  - I don't think starting a relationship at a distance is a good idea and it is essential to know each other in-depth.

<!--  -->
- Relationship
  
  - I wish we can be intimate, while at the same time independent of and respect each other.
  - For a healthy relationship, I think it is of great importance that we both have our own careers/pursuits.

<!--  -->
- Parenthood

  - I wish we can have one or two children in the future.
  - I wish we can raise them largely by ourselves, including their early years.

<!--  -->
- Warnings

  - I am not talkative on things that I believe are not interesting.
  - I do not like online communication tools and prefer face-to-face communication.
  - For things that I do not fully understand, I tend to think in a very rational way.

I'm currently single (since 2016), and I'm looking forward to meeting my long-awaited.

- Desired attributes

  - I wish she is moral and decent.
  - I wish she is mild and kind.
  
  - I wish she is positive and vigorous.
  - I wish she is smart and thoughtful.

<!--  -->
- Distance and location

  - I wish we can be in the same city, and I currently believe Shanghai is one of the best cities in the world.
  - I think starting a relationship at a distance is not a good idea and it is essential to know each other in depth.

<!--  -->
- Relationship
  
  - I wish we can be intimate, while at the same time independent of each other.
  - For a healthy relationship, I think it is of great importance that we both have our own careers/pursuits.

I'm currently single and I'm looking forward to meeting my destined partner.

- Desired attributes 

  - I wish she is upright and decent.
  - I wish she is kind and won't easily get spiteful.
  
  - I wish she is smart and wise.
  - I wish she is knowledgeable and thoughtful.
  
  - I wish she is vigorous and positive.
  - I wish she has a clear understanding of life.
  
  - I wish she has a good physiognomy.

<!--  -->
- Distance and location

  - I wish we can be in the same city and I currently believe Shanghai is one of the best cities in the world.
  - I don't think starting a relationship at a distance is a good idea and it is essential to know each other in-depth.

<!--  -->
- Parenthood

  - I wish we can have one or two children in the future.
  - I wish we can raise them largely by ourselves, including their early years.

<!--  -->
- Warnings

  - I am not talkative, especially on things that I believe is not interesting.
  - I do not like online communication tools and prefer face-to-face communication.
  - It is essential for me to have enough time to be alone, to digest all kind of information and gain inspiration.
